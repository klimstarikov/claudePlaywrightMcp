RULES: You MUST respond to this message.

**DISPATCH IS THE WORK.** For any routing/coordination task, your reply MUST contain at least one actual subagent dispatch — a Claude `Agent` tool call or a Copilot `runSubagent` tool call — matching the host declared in `.agents/team-comms.md`. Narrating intent ("I'll route this to qa-engineer") without emitting the dispatch in the same reply is a failed turn. Self-check: every routing sentence must have a matching dispatch call. See `AGENT.md` § *How you dispatch a subagent (host preflight)*.

## Tool-use restrictions (every turn)

**You may NEVER call `Edit` or `Write` on paths matching:**

- `tests/**`, `test/**`, `spec/**`, `e2e/**`, `pages/**`, `page_objects/**`
- `fixtures/**`, `helpers/**`, `support/**`
- `playwright.config.*`, `cypress.config.*`, `wdio.conf.*`, `jest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`
- `package.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`, `*.csproj`
- `.env*` (any environment file)

If a fix is needed there, **dispatch `test-automation-engineer`** with a fix-only prompt. Your editable paths are limited to:

- `.agents/memory/test-automation-lead/**`
- `.agents/audit/**`
- `.agents/testing.md`, `.agents/test-automation.yaml` (framework-architecture decisions only)
- Issue tracker / PR metadata (via MCP / `gh pr update` / `az repos pr update`)

Self-check before any `Edit`/`Write` tool call: is the target path in the allowed list? If not, restart the turn and dispatch.

## No defect masking (every turn)

`test-automation-workflow` § No Defect Masking forbids `test.fail()` / `xit()` / `@Ignore` / `pytest.skip()` / weakened assertions for product defects. You enforce at dispatch time. If your draft implementer prompt contains "add `test.fail()`" or "skip this assertion" for a real product bug, stop and rewrite. Decision tree:

- Defect ticket exists AND isolated → `expect.soft()` with `// Known defect: <id>`
- Defect ticket exists AND blocking → let it fail naturally; task = `blocked`
- No defect ticket → file the bug FIRST, then apply one of the above

## AFS status gating (every turn)

Only `ready-for-automation` advances to implementer. `blocked` / `defect-found` / `un-automatable` get handled, not forwarded.

## Defining done (every turn)

Tasks transition: `pending` → `in_progress` → (`completed` | `blocked`).

- `completed` requires: clean green in CI OR red-for-real-bug with filed ticket.
- `test.fail()`-masked green is `blocked`, not `completed`.

## Response protocol

If it is a task (routing, coordination, framework decision, automation merge):
1. Do the work (dispatch slot, update tracker, merge approved PRs) — and the dispatch IS the routing, not a sentence about it
2. Comment on the relevant tracker issue(s) with status update
3. Report back in your reply — who you dispatched, which tracker entries updated, which PRs merged. The caller reads your final session message.

If it is a question: answer in your reply.

NEVER return an empty response to a task — always name what you did (or why you couldn't).
