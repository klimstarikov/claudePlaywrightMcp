# Project Seeder

Generate the configuration files that agent roles need to work in a
project.

## Step 0.5 — PR-sampling survey

Before writing any content files, scout samples the project's PR
history to understand **how the team actually works** — not just
what the code looks like. It classifies PRs into five categories
(framework / test-impl / bugfix / feature / review signal), samples
2–3 per category (max ~15 total), and extracts signals that feed
`.agents/workflow.md`, `.agents/testing.md`, `.agents/conventions.md`,
and `.agents/architecture.md`.

Git host is detected first (GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket / Azure
DevOps / Gitea) so the correct CLI is used. Empty repos get a stub
workflow.md and the seed continues.

**Full procedure** — host detection table, classification rules,
sampling rules, signal-to-destination table, report format — lives
in **[references/scout-survey.md](references/scout-survey.md) § Step
0.5**.

## Step 0.7 — Project-systems capture

After PR sampling, scout resolves the project-systems map — issue
tracker, TMS, KB, bug-filing style, automation PR policy — and
writes it into `.agents/profile.md` § Project systems. The operator
can pre-fill these in the onboarding prompt (under a
`## Project systems` block); unspecified fields become `ASK` and
scout either asks interactively or writes `Unconfirmed`.

Downstream skills read this section at runtime:
`test-case-analysis` (bug filing), `bugfix-workflow` (tracker CLI),
`test-automation-workflow` (test-case storage),
`project-manager` + `test-automation-engineer` (merge policy, base
branch).

**Full procedure** — all 11 captured fields, defaults, destinations,
report format — lives in **[references/scout-survey.md](references/scout-survey.md)
§ Step 0.7**.

## Step 1 — Generate CLAUDE.md

The most immediately impactful file. Claude Code loads it
automatically at the start of every session, so every agent has
project context without doing anything. **Keep it under 80 lines.**

**Check first — it may already exist:**

```bash
cat CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NOT FOUND"
```

- **If it doesn't exist:** create it fresh from the template in
  `references/templates.md`.
- **If it exists:** treat it as the engineer's carefully crafted
  document. Read the whole thing before touching anything. Make only
  surgical additions for genuinely missing facts (e.g. a command you
  verified that isn't listed). Fix only clear errors. Do not
  restructure, reword, or "improve" prose — the wording is
  intentional. When in doubt, leave it alone and ask the engineer
  directly. **Preserve any `<!-- BUNDLE:<id> START -->` … `END -->`
  block verbatim** — it's a team bundle's conventions, not yours to edit.

**What belongs here:** one-paragraph project overview, 3–5 most
important commands (install, dev, test), critical conventions, key
paths (entry points, test dirs, config files), a pointer to
`AGENTS.md` for full detail.

**What does NOT belong here:** exhaustive command lists (that's
AGENTS.md), full architecture diagrams (`.agents/architecture.md`),
long convention catalogues (`.agents/conventions.md`).

## Step 2 — Generate AGENTS.md

The full team reference. Every role reads it on-demand. Use the
template in `references/templates.md` and fill it with actual
findings.

**Key sections:** project overview (1 paragraph), tech stack,
repository structure (directory tree with annotations), build & run
commands (install, dev, test, lint, deploy), coding conventions
(detected from codebase), testing (framework, commands, patterns),
CI/CD, environment.

**Rules:**
- Only document what you've verified. Don't guess build commands.
- Include the ACTUAL commands from package.json scripts, Makefile
  targets, CI config.
- Note inconsistencies: "README says `npm test` but CI runs
  `npx jest --ci`".
- Keep it under 200 lines. Link to `.agents/` files for details.
- **Preserve bundle blocks.** If `AGENTS.md` already contains any
  `<!-- BUNDLE:<id> START -->` … `<!-- BUNDLE:<id> END -->` block, copy
  it through verbatim — it was installed by a team bundle and holds that
  team's working agreements. Read existing `AGENTS.md` before
  regenerating; keep every bundle block intact (placement doesn't
  matter — keep it whole). Never edit or drop the marker lines.

## Step 3 — Generate .agents/profile.md

Quick-reference card with YAML frontmatter (project, team, issue-
tracker, default-branch, languages). See `references/templates.md`.

## Step 4 — Generate .agents/conventions.md (if patterns detected)

Only create if you found clear patterns. Document what IS, not what
should be. Cover naming, import ordering, error handling, code
organization, comment/doc style.

## Step 5 — Generate .agents/architecture.md (if complex)

Only for multi-service or non-trivial architectures: service/component
map, data flow, API boundaries, database schema overview,
infrastructure diagram (text-based).

## Step 6 — Generate .agents/testing.md (if test infra exists)

QA engineer reads this. Include test framework and config, how to
run tests (exact commands), fixture/setup patterns, test data
strategy, CI test pipeline, coverage tools, known flaky areas.

## Step 6.5 — Generate .agents/team-comms.md

Every project gets a scout-generated `.agents/team-comms.md` that
names the host, the installed personas, and the exact invocation syntax.

**Full procedure** — host detection, persona enumeration, template
selection, Copilot capability declaration, idempotence rules — lives
in **[references/team-comms-workflow.md](references/team-comms-workflow.md)**.
Templates live in
**[references/team-comms-templates.md](references/team-comms-templates.md)**.

## Step 6.8 — Wire agent tool whitelists (restrictive hosts)

Hosts that default to a restrictive tool-permission model — notably
GitHub Copilot CLI, where an agent with no `tools:` line only gets
`['agent']` — need a per-agent `tools:` whitelist written into the
installed agent frontmatter. Claude Code's permissive default means
this step skips on that host.

Scout is **fully autonomous** at this step — no operator prompts, no
per-agent capability manifest. It derives the whitelist from evidence
already available: each skill's `setup.yaml`
(`dependencies.mcp[].name`), `.agents/test-automation.yaml` (TMS
mapping), live MCP servers on the host, and each agent's frontmatter.

**Full procedure** — host detection, skill-and-MCP matching,
intent-based tool scoping, failure handling, idempotence rules —
lives in **[references/agent-tools-wiring.md](references/agent-tools-wiring.md)**.

## Step 6.9 — Role substitutions (missing roles)

Scout compares the **workflow slots** the project needs (from
installed workflow skills + stated pipelines) against the **installed
agent roster**. For any slot lacking a dedicated agent, scout picks
the best-matching installed agent and injects per-project routing
overrides into the AGENT.md files of the routing agents (PM, tech-
lead, any other agent whose handoff prompts name specific agents).

Lightweight substitution (SCOUT-INJECTED marker-bracketed section)
is the default; full persona rewrite (Step 7) is the escalation when
the installed agent is too distant from the slot.

Runs automatically after Step 6.8. No-op when every needed slot has
its dedicated agent installed.

**Full procedure** — role-similarity table, injection format,
idempotence rules, per-agent injection locations, report format —
lives in **[references/role-overrides.md](references/role-overrides.md)**.

## Step 7 — Role customization (non-default stacks)

Only runs when the detected stack doesn't match the default role set
(e.g. game engines, Rust CLIs, data science). Skip entirely if
defaults fit.

**Full procedure** — SOUL.md / AGENT.md rewrites, role memory seeding —
lives in
**[references/role-customization.md](references/role-customization.md)**.

## Validation

After generating, verify:

```bash
# Core files exist
ls CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md .agents/profile.md

# CLAUDE.md is brief (auto-loaded — must not be bloated)
wc -l CLAUDE.md  # should be under 80 lines

# AGENTS.md is readable
wc -l AGENTS.md  # should be under 200 lines

# No secrets leaked anywhere scout wrote
grep -ri "password\|secret\|token\|api_key" CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md .agents/ 2>/dev/null || echo "clean"

# Bundle blocks survived regeneration (paired START/END markers, if any)
grep -c "<!-- BUNDLE:.* START -->" AGENTS.md 2>/dev/null  # must equal the END count

# Agent tool whitelists wired (only expected under Copilot CLI / restrictive hosts)
if ls .github/agents/*.agent.md >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  grep -L "^tools:" .github/agents/*.agent.md | head || echo "all agent files declare tools:"
fi

# Memory files present and non-empty for all roles
ls .agents/memory/
find .agents/memory -name 'project_briefing.md' -exec wc -l {} +
```
