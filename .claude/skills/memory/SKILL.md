# Memory

Persistent per-role memory as plain markdown. You — the agent — read and
write these files directly using your `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, and `Glob`
tools. No CLI, no script, no shell-path fragility. Works on any host, from
any working directory.

## File layout

Under `.agents/memory/<role>/` (where `<role>` matches your agent's
`name:` frontmatter — e.g. `project-manager`, `python-dev`, `scout`):

```
.agents/memory/<role>/
├── MEMORY.md                ← curated index, one line per entry
├── <slug>.md                ← individual curated entries (frontmatter + body)
├── project_briefing.md      ← seeded by scout at install time (type: project)
├── daily/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md        ← episodic daily logs, append-only
└── snapshot.md              ← auto-generated on launch (may be absent)
```

Create directories with `mkdir -p` on first use. Do not touch
`snapshot.md` — the host's launch hook owns it. If it's absent,
that's fine: you read memory directly when you need it.

`.agents/` is an IDE-neutral path so the same memory works whether this
agent is running under Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, or
Copilot CLI.

## Legacy paths (one-time migration)

If you find memory under one of these older locations and `.agents/memory/<role>/`
doesn't exist, migrate it before your first write:

| Old location | New location |
|---|---|
| `.claude/memory/<role>/` (directory) | `.agents/memory/<role>/` — move the whole dir |
| `.agents-legacy/memory/<role>/` (directory, older install) | `.agents/memory/<role>/` — move the whole dir |
| `.claude/memory/<role>.md` (flat file, from the former `project-seeder` skill) | `.agents/memory/<role>/project_briefing.md` — wrap the existing content with `type: project` frontmatter (see "Write" op below), add one index line to `MEMORY.md` |

Migrate with `Bash` (`mv` for directories) or `Read`/`Write` (for the flat
file → curated entry conversion). Do this once; afterwards ignore the old
paths.

## Two stores, two purposes

| Store | When to use | Cost | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Daily log** | Anything today's you would want tomorrow's you to know. Episodic, transient, cheap. | 1 line appended | "User pushed back on adding a new flag; wants to reuse existing config key" |
| **Curated entry** | Durable facts, preferences, decisions, references. Should still be useful in 6 months. | 1 index slot | User's timezone; a validated correction about testing strategy |

**If unsure: log it.** You can promote to a curated entry later. Never the
reverse.

## Four curated types

Every curated entry carries a `type:` field:

| Type | Holds |
|---|---|
| `user` | Who the user is — role, expertise, preferences, working style |
| `feedback` | Corrections and validated approaches. Always include *why* |
| `project` | Goals, deadlines, constraints, in-flight initiatives. Decays fast — re-verify before acting. **Scout seeds one here at install time (`project_briefing.md`)** covering stack, conventions, and role-specific gotchas. |
| `reference` | Pointers to external systems (Linear projects, Slack channels, dashboards) |

## Operations

### Log — append to today's daily log

To record `<text>`:

1. Determine today's date. Use the `Today's date is …` line in your
   environment context. If not present, run `date -u +%Y-%m-%d`.
2. Target path: `.agents/memory/<role>/daily/<today>.md`.
3. If the file **does not exist**, `Write` it:
   ```
   # Daily log — <today>

   - [HH:MM] <text>
   ```
4. If the file **already exists**, `Edit` to append a single new line at
   the end: `- [HH:MM] <text>`.

Use 24-hour `HH:MM`. One observation per line. Keep it terse — full
sentences are fine; paragraphs belong in curated entries.

### Write — create or replace a curated entry

To record a curated entry named `<name>` with `<type>`, `<description>`,
and `<content>`:

1. **Slugify** `<name>`: lowercase, replace non-alphanumerics with `_`,
   strip leading/trailing underscores. Example: `User Timezone` →
   `user_timezone`.
2. **Target path**: `.agents/memory/<role>/<slug>.md`.
3. **`Write`** the file with this exact frontmatter (`name`, `description`,
   `type` are parsed by the snapshot generator — don't omit them, don't
   add extra keys, keep each on one line):
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: <name>
   description: <description>
   type: <type>
   ---

   <content>
   ```
4. **Update the index** at `.agents/memory/<role>/MEMORY.md`:
   - **If `MEMORY.md` doesn't exist**, `Write` it:
     ```markdown
     # Memory index — <role>

     - [<name>](<slug>.md) — <description>
     ```
   - **If a line already refers to `<slug>.md`**, `Edit` that single line
     to the new description. One entry = one line, no duplicates.
   - **Otherwise**, `Edit` to append one new line at the end:
     `- [<name>](<slug>.md) — <description>`.

### Read — recall memory on demand

1. **If a snapshot was auto-imported** (the `@.agents/memory/<role>/snapshot.md`
   line at the top of your AGENT.md), you already have curated memory and
   recent daily logs in your context — don't re-read them.
2. **If no snapshot loaded** (first session on a fresh project, or host
   without a launch hook), read memory directly:
   - `Read .agents/memory/<role>/MEMORY.md` for the curated index.
   - `Read .agents/memory/<role>/<slug>.md` for any entry the index
     points you at. Scout's `project_briefing.md` is usually the most
     load-bearing on a new project.
   - `Glob .agents/memory/<role>/daily/*.md`, sort by filename
     descending, and `Read` the most recent 3 files.

Bounded recall keeps your context small — don't tail the whole daily log
history.

### Rename / delete

- **Rename** a curated entry: `Write` the new `<new-slug>.md`, remove the
  old file, `Edit` `MEMORY.md` to replace the single line.
- **Delete**: remove `<slug>.md`, `Edit` `MEMORY.md` to drop its line.
- **Never edit a daily-log entry after the fact.** Log a correction as a
  new line instead — the audit trail is the point.

## What belongs in memory vs. somewhere else

- **Memory** — durable facts and ephemeral working notes that matter *to
  you as an agent* across sessions: user preferences, project constraints,
  lessons from corrections, references to external systems.
- **Not memory** — anything a human other than you should be able to find.
  That goes in the user's knowledge base (e.g. `obsidian-vault`), the
  project's docs, the issue tracker, or the code itself.

Some agents also keep role-specific operational state in this directory
(e.g. personal-assistant's `people-pending.md`). That's fine — the layout
is yours to extend, as long as `MEMORY.md`, `<slug>.md`, and `daily/`
follow the spec above.

---

## Snapshot.md — host launch hook concern, not yours

`snapshot.md` is regenerated by the host's launch hook before each session.
It inlines `MEMORY.md`, every curated entry body, and the last 3 days of
daily logs into a single file that the agent's `AGENT.md` auto-imports via
`@.agents/memory/<role>/snapshot.md`.

You never write `snapshot.md` yourself. If it's missing, the `@import`
becomes a no-op and you fall back to on-demand reads — no error, no
interruption.
